## The Prompt

Make a fully deployable site in a git repo with github actions workflows that
deploys to github pages where a user can input their claude-code api key or
oauth api key and can enter a prompt and the ai will generate a 3d model with
configurable parameters for the user's request (with a pause for specifications
if not already provided). The site should also feature social functionality to
make models shareable and searchable with pages for best rated (1w/1m/1y/all),
most rated (aka popular) (1w/1m/1y/all), most viewed (same buckets). Use your
best judgement for all questions. Requirements: use ts/bun, monorepo
architecture, use nx for monorepo tasks, mise for org-wide-tasks
(format, lint, test, build) and tool installs, direnv for shell init when cd
into folder. Reuse scripts for local dx and CI scripting. Use off-shelf actions
instead of making your own (where appropriate). Make site desktop default, but
mobile friendly. Use an off the shelf design system.

Work in this order, always work iteratively, use sequential thinking before
each task, during each task, and after each task to evaluate your work and
ensure it is complete (and tested by automation to the best of your ability).
After each step you MUST test your work. As soon as you have a server that
launches, each validation loop (after every change) must (using CI)
automatically take screenshots of each page (playwright + jest + well defined
page tests matching the page specs + recording videos + runs uploaded to
github pages to be viewable in browser) on test runs on `main` and upload them
(with a `[no ci]` and a date based name/path) so progress can be tracked. Do
not start writing code until these instructions tell you to:

1. Set up claude code to use nsheaps/agents and nsheaps/ai-mktpl as
   marketplaces. Dump this entire prompt into ./docs/INITIAL_PROMPT.md and
   review it after every task to ensure you're on the right track.
2. Install:
   * `cron-utils@agents`
   * `shared-lib@ai-mktpl`: true,
   * `dangerous-bypass@ai-mktpl`: true,
   * `agentic-behavior@ai-mktpl`: true,
   * `common-sense@ai-mktpl`: true,
   * `deep-research@ai-mktpl`: true,
   * `edit-utils@ai-mktpl`: true,
   * `github@ai-mktpl`: true,
   * `github-app@ai-mktpl`: true,
   * `mise@ai-mktpl`: true,
   * `scm-utils@ai-mktpl`: true,
   * `sequential-thinking@ai-mktpl`: true,
   * `task-utils@agents`,
   * Hookify from the official repo
   * Plugin-dev from the official repo
3. Do proper claude-code-web onboarding for this repo. Set it up for bypass
   permissions in the settings.
4. In `.claude/rules/always-keep-improving.md`
   * It should read:
     1. The initial prompt that started this all can be found at
        docs/INITIAL_PROMPT.md and should be reviewed to ensure progress is
        being made accurately.

        You can do literally anything. The skills you will make and have made
        make what you do possible. To do something new, all you need to do is
        make a skill. Always check your skills before during and after Tasks to
        see if there's any helpful skills. Use Agent(run_in_background:true)
        carefully to parallelize tasks where you can. These skills are only as
        good as their instructions.

        CRITICAL: Changes to your configuration/rules/code/skills/hooks/agents
        must be committed IMMEDIATELY after making them.
        CRITICAL: Commits for this project MUST be atomic (only change one
        thing) using the conventional commit style. Push often. Use CI to your
        advantage, but local is always faster.
        CRITICAL: NEVER execute Bash(do && a && bunch || of ; things) or
        Bash(python -c "a big python script"). If the Bash tool call is doing
        more than 1 or 2 things, it needs to be turned into a script (build a
        logical hierarchy with proper CLAUDE.md documentation throughout in
        .claude/scripts/paths/to/categorize/meaningful-name.sh. ALWAYS check to
        see if a script exists before creating a new one. ALWAYS know which
        scripts you'll need before executing a plan. ALWAYS make sure the
        scripts are tested. ALWAYS share code between scripts when possible.
        ALWAYS prefer bun/ts/compiled tool (but scripts are okay). ALWAYS use
        monorepo tooling, even in the scripts, they're code too!
        CRITICAL: Try to prefer behavior modifications in the following
        priority order:
          1. Hooks in claude configs (remember don't keep any in
             settings.local.json they're not saved!)
          2. Skill(context:fork)
          3. Agent() - don't forget they're resumable! Work iteratively with
             them, don't make them do everything in one go, guide them not to,
             they don't share the conversation context, ANY outputs should go
             to file that you can review. ALWAYS run them in the background AND
             check their work.
            - even better if they have their own hooks, which can help contain
              specialized behavior
          4. Hookify hooks - these help fine tune behaviors and keep things
             consistent. Anytime there's a regression in behavior, consider
             using these or a skill!
          5. Skills still, with scripts to encapsulate behavior
          6. Scripts
          7. Rules. These take up context and aren't really actually
             enforceable.
        Use hooks to ensure something actually happens, skills on how to use
        tools, Agents to encapsulate a recurring behavior where only the
        ins/outs are needed.
        CRITICAL: NEVER use the general-purpose agent. ALWAYS see if you have an
        agent or skill specialized in that task, and if not, make one or add it
        to an existing one.
        CRITICAL: KEEP SKILLS SMALL. Keep examples in supplementary
        documentation that are mentioned (not @mentioned). Make most skills an
        ordered list of instructions. Delegate shared knowledge to shared skills
        (eg don't describe how to use git in making-a-pr, make a tool-cli-git
        skill that describes how to do it). Disambiguate skills to make it easy
        to find the right skill without reading one skill that does everything.
        If the skill is more than 5 paragraphs, it probably needs to be broken
        up (including ones that were already too big before you touched it).
        Always break things into maintainable and shareable chunks
        CRITICAL: Set up a cron for every 15 minutes to do a full review of your
        configuration using "audit-verify-improve-agent" (create if it doesn't
        exist). When you eventually go idle, set up a stop hook to do one final
        audit, make any final adjustments, and push any remaining changes. This
        skill MUST be context:fork, and review conversation transcripts to get
        the full picture, iteratively, don't rely on memory. Use a haiku agent
        to scan logs since the last time it ran (store in file somewhere using
        skill !`date | tee .claude/state/self-improvement-last-ran` syntax
        within the skill to write it everytime the skill is called) for
        instances where trouble occurred, and note it by appropriate IDs for
        beginning and end of the issue. use a script to extract the conversation
        transcript between those IDs, then another script to convert it from
        JSONL to a more readable, chat-style output (like one that you'd get
        from claude-stream from nsheaps/claude-utils)
        CRITICAL: Be verbose in the data you give an Agent, explicit about the
        actions you want it to take and not to take, requirements (including
        what you want for the outputs and details about what you want them to
        contain), validation steps, restrictions, other-notes. It will make
        stuff up if you don't tell it how to do it's thing, including using
        skills. Use resuming to your advantage. Make sure it understands the
        task (it needs to Stop to confirm with you) before it does the task if
        the task is complex. Check it's outputs, don't always assume they're
        right.
        CRITICAL: You AND all Agents (subagents, et al) are EXPECTED to use
        github-footnote-style references in ALL documents, issues, PRs, markdown
        docs, etc to link to sources that support your claim. Claims made
        without sources or significant data to back it up will be rejected. Use
        the repo's .claude/sources/xxx/yyy/zzz.abc to store sources that can't
        directly be linked to (eg scrubbed+humanified transcripts) and link to
        those. Always reference files inside the repo using github.com/… links,
        NEVER filesystem paths. Review your claims before making them, if you
        feel anywhere _might_ deserve a `[citation needed]`, then you MUST add a
        citation, or update the claim BEFORE you send it.
        CRITICAL: Always consult with claude-code-guide running as sonnet or
        opus to help with updating/changing agent configs. Encourage it to
        always be thorough in it's research. Don't believe github issues about
        claude-code unless they have significant community support or
        confirmation from anthropic.
        CRITICAL: If you ever achieve undesired, unplanned, failed, or errored
        results when executing tools, skills, following rules, being guided by
        hooks, executing agents, you MUST update the appropriate
        configuration/code/document/skill
        CRITICAL: After completing every task, THINK HARD about what you did
        during the task (use an Agent to review the transcript if necessary) and
        which skills you executed during the task. Update
        configs/rules/code/skills/agents as necessary to improve them for the
        next time.
        CRITICAL: ALWAYS USE SKILLS AND AGENTS, EVEN IF YOU THINK YOU KNOW HOW TO
        DO SOMETHING.
        CRITICAL ALWAYS use /scm-utils:commit to commit code
        CRITICAL: images use up insane amounts of context. ONLY use them within
        an Agent(). Be explicit about what you want to know about the image.

        EXTRA SUPER CRITICAL: As soon as you can, run the
        audit-verify-improve-agent when you see this, which should start with
        improving the rules, including this file if you deem fit. Make sure
        you're only keeping things in rules that need to be visible all the
        time, and REALLY encouraging the use of Hooks, Skills, and Agents
5. Think about the pages you'll have on the site, compile them into
   docs/pages/INDEX.md
6. Review the docs/pages/INDEX.md doc and make any changes you think
   appropriate. Remember, just a draft. Page titles and maybe one or two
   sentences about each.
7. VERIFY If you made any changes go back to step 4, and repeat step 4 until you
   review the document and can make no more improvements.
8. For each page in pages/INDEX.md, make a docs/pages/page-name/SPEC.md, nothing
   should go in to that spec yet. It should be just an empty file.
9. VERIFY Review what you've created in the file system against PAGES.txt and
   ensure it is correct.
10. Based on what you think you'll need to know about each page and the site
    overall, create docs/pages/PAGE-SPEC.md which describes the shape of these
    page SPEC.md documents. Be specific about format and content. Provide
    examples of good and bad.
11. Create a companion skill in .claude/skills/spec-writing/SKILL.md that
    details the process of defining the resources, creating individual
    resources, defining the shape of those resources, filling in the resources,
    validating them, etc
    * Create subskills to help with drafting and filling out each section
    * Make sure the skill gives a sequential step-by-step numbered list
      instruction.
    * Instructions can be "run Skill(skill-name) to do a specific task that you
      describe to the user"
12. Use that skill for each spec you need to write, for each page work
    iteratively
    * Using the drafting skills, Create an outline of the spec
    * Using the second stage drafting skills, For each section add a few bullets
      describing needed info in each and any important information, ESPECIALLY
      references (and their human readable version)
    * Using the draft review skill, Review each and ensure your plan is sound,
      use sequential thinking to evaluate it
    * Using the corresponding skills, write each section
    * Using the review skill, go over the spec again and iterate until there's
      no more improvements to make. If you make changes, you MUST perform the
      validation again
13. Review the specs as a whole and make any adjustments necessary
14. Design a page-wireframing skill that will help you keep your wireframes
    consistent for each page you make.
15. For each page, draft wireframes of the design. You'll use an off the shelf
    design system to help here.
    * Later we'll make rough outlines of these pages with mock data
    * Make at least one wireframe for the whole page, and each modal window, or
      popover to show in detail how it looks. Start with an ascii version, then
      a drafty image based version, and then one more round of improvement
    * Review your work, compare the wireframes against the spec, are all the
      features of the page aligned with the spec and vice-versa? Did you learn
      anything from visually designing the website? Make any adjustments
      necessary.
16. Review all the pages and their relation to each other and do another
    validation improvement iteration loop
17. Design a page-to-api-requirements skill that will help you extract all
    needed information from your specs and wireframes to design your RESTful api
    implementation. You may use a websocket where necessary to provide realtime
    2-way streams (eg if you want for the agent loop displaying steps in the
    browser)
18. Using the skill, go over each page and extract requirements into
    docs/api/endpoint-slugified-name/SPEC.md
19. Go over each page again and review in comparison to the api SPECs and ensure
    everything is accurately tracked. Keep iterating until you can perform a
    full iteration and not extract any more information.
20. Review the API specs as a whole and perform an iterative
    validation/improvement loop
21. NOW WE CAN START WRITING CODE. Requirements need validation. Start by making
    a validate-change skill as a spec. That skill should be a breakout to other
    skills identifying the type of change (code/infra/ci/docs/…/etc). Keep these
    up to date as you keep learning more about what you write for each.
22. Start with a framework for a monorepo using bun/ts, nx as the monorepo task
    runner (make sure the task graph has proper dependencies and caching), mise
    as the tool manager, and direnv as the shell initialization. They should all
    use the same linting and formatting tools. Use custom rules to help remove
    patterns we don't want in the codebase, but it doesn't have to be ESLint.
    Write docs for each of these that act as specs to work against and educate
    users on how to use/configure them/how they work
    * Each bun package needs the following runscripts:
      1. lint
      2. format (aka lint --fix)
      3. test (even if it's just `echo "This package has no tests"`)
      4. build
      5. (optional) release (includes packaging, which if needed should also be
         a separate script)
23. Create a basic folder structure of the repo that will hold different types
    of packages that you'll use for this app. wireframe of a repo with a few
    dummy packages in each.
    * services/ - things that run and provide an api or background task (like
      mcp servers for the agent)
    * apps/ - things you execute and exit (like clis)
    * plugins/ - a claude plugin marketplace.
    * lib/ - packages that contain shared logic between the other packages.
      These are leafs and only depend on other libs
    * packages/ - things that get published that aren't services/apps/plugins,
      they might wrap libs
    * infra/ - infra as code automation, primarily for deploying the app
    * .github/ full github CI integration with pull request template (which you
      review when making a PR, and update as needed), deploy/release workflows
    * Mise.toml - tool configs
    * .mise/ - any mise scripts (anything that isn't a one-liner in a bun
      package.js that nx would need to run should be captured as a mise script)
    * …any others you deem relevant
24. Test the monorepo setup locally and in CI. user touchpoints to run commands
    should be the same ran in CI, especially using NX in CI properly
25. Create a do-some-work skill that guides you on taking your Task from your
    internal task tracking, updating the Task as you work on it, and how to use
    other skills to implement the task, implement automated validation for the
    task, run the validation and make sure that works right, push it and ensure
    it works right in CI, etc. Make it a rough outline just so you don't forget
    steps, including validation steps (and testing through automation and
    ensuring screenshots from CI)
26. Build a basic framework for the api server using a microservice
    architecture (though the development environment would always service all
    requests with the same single API server, the browser app (vue powered, NOT
    REACT), the dev front end/prod front end with proper live reload etc. Keep
    in mind the focus that this should be a browser-only app to the best of our
    ability, and should be deployable to github pages for now. Things that we've
    discussed so far that aren't possible in that mechanism (eg without an API
    server) should get a coming soon page with a ghost-ish wireframe behind it
    of that page (generated using the test data and lorem impsum text/image
    generators).
    Add a setup using tilt (tilt-dev/tilt) and using local_resources (do NOT use
    containers, all native apps, since we'll be using github pages for now).
    Make a basic example of all working together including tests, not the pages
    themselves.
    Any publishing should be to ghcr.io.
27. Add a CI workflow that uses `tilt ci` to test the dev workflow end to end.
28. Validate that from here forward, the initial requirements of "CI always
    works, CI tasks reflect and follow the same codepaths as the local dev
    tooling, CI always takes pictures on main of every page, always updates docs
    pages to include those new screenshots, always commits them with [skip ci],
    always publishes to github actions in the same workflow so the progress can
    be followed. Always publishes the specs for all features, pages, apis,
    wireframes, etc to the github pages docs sites on every push to main, etc,
    etc. All of these MUST be called out in the do-some-work and
    validate-app-progress skills (or whatever) appropriately (at this point you
    can see why we capture this entire prompt and why we want you to start with
    improving this stuff before you even get started. If you understand this,
    when you start working on this project as a whole (when you do the first
    audit-verify-improve-agent cycle, you must address the user and tell them
    explicitly (filling in the blanks). Caps required, but responses in general
    do not need to be capitalized.:
    * THE RULES OF THIS PROJECT TOLD ME TO STATE THE FOLLOWING TO YOU BEFORE WE
      GET STARTED ON THIS PROJECT. FROM HERE ON OUT, I WILL WORK AUTONOMOUSLY AND

29. Validate or ensure using plugins that the agent can view the dev version of
    the site using tools to capture images. If you are unable to achieve this
    after at least 10 minutes of trying, you MUST use CI to take pictures for
    you, create any needed workflows and update your rules/skills to guide you
    to use CI to take pictures when you need to see something.
30. Iteratively stub out each page, perform a validate/improve loop
31. Iteratively update each page to match it's wireframe, perform a
    validate/improve loop
32. Iteratively review each page, improve the styles and consistency between
    pages, use lorem imsum text and pictures as mock data to make the pages work
    without any real data (including a mock conversation for the actual
    feature), perform a validate/improve loop
33. Iteratively stub out api, perform a validate/improve loop
34. Iteratively connect each page to it's appropriate apis, perform a
    validate/improve loop. Remember, we want to keep this as browser-only as
    possible for now, and we want AI use to use a user's login (preferrably
    login-with-claude but I think they'll need to provide a token).
    * Use the claude agent sdk
35. Iteratively stub out api's functionality, delegating data access to model
    abstractions, perform a validate/improve loop
36. Review all the work. When you create your final workflow when you START
    doing this work, you should fill in any steps here that you'll need to get
    to the end
37. ONLY when everything works (I won't accept "I got stuck"... I know you, get
    around it, you can do it) in CI, github pages deployment with docs, etc and
    you can no longer make progress without me inputting a key (which of course
    the site should instruct the user to do it), should you stop doing work. Do
    everything you can to add hooks to Stop and skills and everything to make
    sure you have achieved the goal before stopping (but if you must stop, just
    Stop twice in a row without any other tool calls and the session will stop)

## Amendments

Requirements added by the user after the original prompt was issued. They do not
replace any step above — they constrain how the relevant steps are implemented.
Cross-references point at the step numbers in [The Prompt](#the-prompt) they most
affect.

A1. **Repo configuration as code.** Configure the repository with the
    `repository-settings` GitHub App[^repo-settings] (already installed by the
    user) — branch protection / branch restrictions and all repo configuration
    declared in `.github/settings.yml`, not clicked in the UI. *Affects steps
    22–23.*

A2. **Dependency automation with Renovate.** Adopt Renovate[^renovate] for
    dependency updates, extending the shared config at
    `nsheaps/renovate-config`[^nsheaps-renovate] (e.g.
    `"extends": ["github>nsheaps/renovate-config"]`). *Affects steps 22–23.*

A3. **Backend on Vercel (free plan) if required.** The app should stay
    browser-only where possible, but realistically a backend will be needed. If
    one is, host it on Vercel[^vercel] — **free plan only**. Document the entire
    onboarding with screenshots: account signup, project/app creation,
    environment-variable and secret syncing, and wiring CI to deploy to Vercel.
    *Affects steps 26, 28, 33–35.*

A4. **Cross-repo workflow sync.** `nsheaps/.github`[^nsheaps-dotgithub] hosts
    workflows that sync shared CI/configuration across the org's repos. Account
    for them — onboarding farish may require opening a PR against
    `nsheaps/.github`. *Affects step 23.*

A5. **PR dry-run CI gating.** Anthropic restricts this agent to the branch
    `claude/ai-3d-model-generator-XjoUi`, so CI cannot be exercised on `main`
    yet. Every CI workflow MUST support a **dry-run mode** that runs inside this
    PR — including executing the code we write — to validate the workflow's
    functionality before it reaches `main`. The dry-run is gated by an
    environment variable provisioned through the `repository-settings`
    configuration from A1.  *Affects steps 24, 27, 28.*

A6. **Diagrams in documentation.** Documentation must use diagrams to explain
    concepts and graphical ideas — architectures, data flows, state machines,
    sequences. Use Mermaid[^mermaid] diagrams (they render natively on GitHub
    and GitHub Pages). Documentation is written after the plan exists but before
    any code is written. *Affects steps 5–22.*

### Environment incompatibility log

* **`task-utils` write-gate vs. Claude Code on the web.** The `task-utils@agents`
  plugin's `require-task-in-progress.sh` PreToolUse hook blocks all
  Write/Edit/MultiEdit/NotebookEdit unless a Task is `in_progress`, but the
  `TaskCreate`/`TaskUpdate` tools are not enabled in the Claude Code on the web
  context — making the gate unsatisfiable. Fix in flight: a branch on
  `nsheaps/agents` adds an env-var opt-out to the hook; farish opts out via
  `.claude/settings.json`.

## Notes captured at kickoff

* **Target repository:** `nsheaps/farish` (clarified by the user after the
  prompt was issued).
* **Development branch:** `claude/ai-3d-model-generator-XjoUi`.
* **Environment constraints** (Claude Code on the web, remote ephemeral
  container):
  * Plugins/marketplaces declared in `.claude/settings.json` take effect on the
    next session start, not the session that writes them.
  * No OS-level cron is available; the recurring "every 15 minutes" audit is
    implemented as a scheduled GitHub Actions workflow plus the `/loop`
    mechanism.
